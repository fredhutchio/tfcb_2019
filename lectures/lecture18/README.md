# Lecture 18: Remote computing

This last session will begin to tie together principles for you, as we begin to explore how to work with genomic data using remote computing. We'll be learning more about data management, as well as how to learn about and operate command-line bioinformatics software. This material represents how you would work with newly derived sequencing data, prior to the analyses we've previously explored in Bioconductor or Biopython.

## Learning objectives

After this session, you should be able to:
- transfer files between local and remote compute resources
- assess and manage the software available in your computing environment
- run command-line genomics software

## Class materials

- The course materials are contained in the file [`lecture18.md`](lecture18.md).
- You should log into Rhino using the instructions from [lecture 9](https://github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/tree/master/lectures/lecture09#tutorial) for this session.
- Download [this file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ksw8rvi517mcsw7/chr22.tar.gz?dl=0) from Dropbox onto your computer (use the button in the upper right hand side of the screen to download). It should save as `chr22.tar` or `chr22.tar.gz` (either is fine).

## Reminders

- Homework 7 will be available by Wednesday, November 27 in GitHub classroom and is due Thursday, December 5 at noon.
- Homework 8 (capstone) will be available Tuesday, December 3 and will be due on Tuesday, December 10 at noon. You will have the entire class session on Thursday, December 5 to work on your capstone and receive feedback.
