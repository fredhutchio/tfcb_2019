    "\n",
    "The 10x genomics single-cell platform is increasingly being used to study T cells, and they've recently released a kit that combines targeted sequencing of the T cell receptor alpha and beta chains with single-cell mRNA sequencing, which is cool because you get both the T cell receptor sequence and also the gene expression phenotype for each cell.\n",
